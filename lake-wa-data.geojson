With a 1.85 square mile watershed, over 44% of which is impervious surface, it is susceptible to scour and erosion.  Most notably, there has been a loss of wetland areas in the basin.  There have been a number of high flow or flood events, most recently in 2007 at the Harbour Village and Marina Cove Condominiums.  The outlet of the stream has since be relocated in a effort to reduce flooding.   Despite a number of impassable barriers that prevent anadromous fish from accessing all but the lowest reaches, this stream supports cutthroat trout, western brook lamprey, sticklebacks, and sculpins.\n\n<p>Monitoring by students from local elementary schools suggests that relatively healthy stream macroinvertebrates inhabit the upper reaches of the stream, but habitat quality degrades in the lower reaches.</p>\n\n<p>The students found water quality was generally good, with the exception of high fecal coliform levels near the mouth.</p>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/iffAK1o.jpg\">","stroke":"#7ec9b1","stroke-width":3,"stroke-opacity":1,"fill":"#3ca0d3","fill-opacity":1},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[[-122.261915,47.757531],[-122.261867,47.757314],[-122.261854,47.756995],[-122.261821,47.756413],[-122.261891,47.756438],[-122.261915,47.756864],[-122.261939,47.75706],[-122.261964,47.757257],[-122.261985,47.757592],[-122.26198,47.757855],[-122.262017,47.758065],[-122.262108,47.758111],[-122.262393,47.758148],[-122.262538,47.758205],[-122.262366,47.75844],[-122.262125,47.758761],[-122.26184,47.759291],[-122.261797,47.759558],[-122.261824,47.759716],[-122.262076,47.76016],[-122.263573,47.761563],[-122.263911,47.761984],[-122.264404,47.765287],[-122.26427,47.765749],[-122.264324,47.767599],[-122.264321,47.767819],[-122.264324,47.76788],[-122.264184,47.767878],[-122.264174,47.767602],[-122.264184,47.766495],[-122.264163,47.766016],[-122.264163,47.765756],[-122.264276,47.765295],[-122.264206,47.764563],[-122.263873,47.762331],[-122.263712,47.761883],[-122.263433,47.761545],[-122.263181,47.761303],[-122.26191,47.760156],[-122.261593,47.759439],[-122.261872,47.758944],[-122.262119,47.758537],[-122.26242,47.758212],[-122.26198,47.75814],[-122.261905,47.75796],[-122.261905,47.75783],[-122.261915,47.757531]]],"type":"Polygon"},"id":"76ce2735d8feb1d76f02ffac6a1c48a9"},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"lakepointe","description":"<h1>Lakepointe</h1>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/0f8QiKm.jpg\">\n<p>\nLakepointe is a landfill site that has been recently used to construct anchors and roadbeds for the new 520 Bridge, and is currently used for the offloading of rubble from the demolition of the old 520 Bridge.  \n</p>\n<p>\nThe demolition process involves the breaking up of the old bridge deck and supporting columns in situ, with concrete chunks being barged to the Lakepointe site, loaded onto trucks and truck to a disposal site.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere has been insufficient testing of this rubble, but some tests have indicated high levels of Arsenic.
