On the West side of Puget Sound, it is part of the critical natural habitat that balances the urbanization of the East side of the Sound, but also faces threats from local population growth. The recently replaced undersized culvert at the mouth of the estuary was creating unnatural flow rates that hindered fish passage, created scour holes, and trapped sediment in the estuary. In 2012, the culvert was replaced with a 90 foot bridge, the Stillwaters Fish Passage. The second part of this restoration is to replace another culvert in the middle of the estuary. This grant will support the related monitoring program, which is critical to the evaluation of its success and in determining further restoration needs, and will also train and educate local citizens on the importance of watershed protection.</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-amount-awarded-header\">Amount Awarded</h3><p>$10,000.00</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-year\">Year</h3><p>2014</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-link-header\">Link</h3><a class=\"rose-grants-external-link\" href=\"http://www.stillwatersenvironmentalcenter.org\">http://www.stillwatersenvironmentalcenter.org</a>",

MGRC board members met with private property owners David and Joanne Treat to assess the site and discuss a potential riparian restoration project on their 6.62 acre parcel that borders Boise Creek in southeast King County.  The Treats responded with enthusiasm and welcome assistance to manage out-of-control invasive vegetation that has overtaken the riparian area on their property.  This reach of stream provides primary spawning and rearing habitat for three Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed fish species: White River spring and fall Chinook, steelhead salmon, and bull trout.\r\rThe project site currently supports well-established Himalayan blackberry (Rubus discolor), and to a lesser extent reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) and other non-native vegetation that collectively dominate a 50 foot width along approximately 450 feet of the Boise Creek riparian zone.  The Phase I project scope includes using organic methods to remove robust stands of Himalayan blackberries and other invasive plants within the riparian zone while preserving existing native trees and shrubs, and then placing temporary barrier fabric where needed to discourage regrowth.  Areas not covered by fabric will be planted with native trees and vegetation.  Phase I will be completed within twelve-months.  In Phase II, the site will be monitored regularly for two to three years to manually remove invasive regrowth and ensure long-term plant survival.  When deemed appropriate by MGRC's restoration specialist, the fabric will be removed and the areas planted with native trees and vegetation.  MGRCï¿½s partners include King County, King Conservation District, Green River Community College, other nonprofit organizations, private and public landowners, and volunteers.</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-amount-awarded-header\">Amount Awarded</h3><p>$10,000.00</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-year\">Year</h3><p>2014</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-link-header\">Link</h3><a class=\"rose-grants-external-link\" href=\"http://www.greenrivercoalition.org/#restoration-projects\">http://www.greenrivercoalition.org/#restoration-projects</a>",

When they learn about the species, they begin to care about it and become interested in learning what they can do to help protect it. This knowledge opens a tremendous gateway for teaching scienceï¿½which teachers love! The curriculum invites students to be scientists; they develop hypotheses, practice field observation using current scientific data, learn to interpret data, and brainstorm ways to decrease human impacts on orcas. \r\rOur program also provides a gateway for making conservation and civic responsibility meaningful to students and their families. Our classroom and take-home activities foster informed decision making as students explore their relationship and responsibility to the world and the whales around them.\r\rAdditionally, we value the quantitative results we receive from our participants.  We have hard numbers and data going back to 2004 that statistically demonstrates the efficacy of our program.  Whether it is how much water a school saved, or how students increased their \"orca IQ\", we monitor it and use it in our future decision making.</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-amount-awarded-header\">Amount Awarded</h3><p>$5,000.00</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-year\">Year</h3><p>2014</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-link-header\">Link</h3><a class=\"rose-grants-external-link\" href=\"\"></a>",

Whale Scouts line the shorelines at local parks, assisting the public in sighting whales. They also teach people what threats whales face, how to help, and inspire protection by encouraging the public to become stewards of the environment. By transforming the awe and amazement of seeing killer whales into action, Whale Scout is restoring Puget Sound.\r\rThe goal of Whale Scout is to recover threatened and endangered whales in the Salish Sea ecosystem through salmon habitat restoration projects and everyday stewardship activities. Volunteers are equipped with identifying vests and weather-proof educational materials to illustrate how much habitat on land is required for the lifecycles of salmon, and in turn, whales. Infographics also illustrate how chemicals from our homes many miles from the ocean work their way through water treatment plants into rivers, Puget Sound, and then finally up the food chain into killer whales. \r\rWhale Scouts are quick to offer opportunities to become stewards of the whales with suggestions like limiting the use of harsh cleaning products and pesticides, or conserving water and electricity. Additionally, we invite the public to join us at quarterly \"Helpin' Out\" events where we partner with local groups to restore salmon habitat. Being outside whale watching and restoring habitats teaches us the inter-connectedness of our ecosystemï¿½s waters and the importance of every small piece of habitat, as well as the role it plays in filtering the water which is the lifeblood of our rivers, streams, salmon, and killer whales. \r\rThis year's team of 13 volunteers is already equipped and doing great work throughout Puget Sound. At high traffic locations such as Alki Point, a single volunteer can connect with 30 people per hour. We are requesting funding to continue and expand our volunteer team and habitat restoration partnerships in 2015.</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-amount-awarded-header\">Amount Awarded</h3><p>$2,500.00</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-year\">Year</h3><p>2014</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-link-header\">Link</h3><a class=\"rose-grants-external-link\" href=\"http://www.whalescout.org\">http://www.whalescout.org</a>",

This program resulted in the implementation of Best Management Practices (BMPs) by horse owners at an even higher rate than expected. Down on the Farm: Least Toxic Solutions for Snohomish County continues that partnership but expands the audience to include commercial and non-commercial livestock/ag producers and focuses the message on chemical use reduction. \r\rIn Horses for Clean Waterï¿½s 17+ years of service we have noted pasture management is a difficult and complex BMP for horse owners to adopt and implement. Additionally, pasture management classes are our biggest draw and horse owners report weed control as a major concern. Traditionally, the solution for most is to spray herbicides. Many do so without realizing there are least-toxic alternatives and that pesticide misuse causes negative impacts. Clearly horse owners need more education on proper pasture management and a deeper understanding of the impacts herbicides have on water quality and invertebrates--as well as education on safe alternatives for managing weeds and pests. \r\rHorses for Clean Water proposes to hold four events targeting chemical use reduction among horse and livestock owners as well as agricultural producers on the following topics: weed and pasture management, pollinator/beneficial insect conservation, and native plants and wildlife enhancement combined with least-toxic pest control. The goal will be for audience members to reduce chemical use and provide wildlife enhancement on their properties as well as use native plants to help reduce mud, runoff and erosion. Participants that implement these BMPs will reduce non-point pollution in Central Puget Sound by reducing runoff of sediments, nutrients and fecal coliform from overgrazed pastures, and chemicals from fertilizer, herbicide or pesticide use/misuse.</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-amount-awarded-header\">Amount Awarded</h3><p>$10,000.00</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-year\">Year</h3><p>2014</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-link-header\">Link</h3><a class=\"rose-grants-external-link\" href=\"http://www.horsesforcleanwater.com\">http://www.horsesforcleanwater.com</a>",

Clear flowing water, large old cedars, and protected forest trails make Shinglemill Creek a popular outdoor destination. However, the beauty of this place is deceptive. Since 2001 people have seen fewer salmon here.  Just this season the Vashon Nature Center (VNC) Salmon Watcher program documented a possible case of pre-spawning mortality in coho. Aquatic invertebrate data reveal that Shinglemill Creek scores lower than other major watersheds on the island for biological integrity and on level with many urban streams in the county.  \rIn 2014, VNC partnered with the Vashon Groundwater Protection Committee (VGPWC) and Vashon School District (VSD) to explore why Shinglemill Creek was scoring so poorly for health. Students worked with VNC scientists to sort over 700 invertebrates from Shinglemill.  What they found surprised them. In this rural creek, invertebrate assemblages showed indicators of stormwater run-off impacts! Student findings changed VGWPC priorities and galvanized community support for stewardship action to curb run-off from Vashon town into Shinglemill.\r In 2015, a grassroots effort involving VNC, Sustainable Vashon, VGWPC, Vashon Maury Island Land Trust and VSD will begin the first step in curbing polluted run-off by installing carwash kits in a parking lot used for student fundraiser carwashes and tracking the effect of this change on creek health.  We are seeking support to involve students in solving stormwater issues and to enlist community members and students as citizen scientists in tracking effects of changes in stormwater management through our Scientists in Schools and Salmon Watchers programs.  We invite the Rose Foundation to partner with us in this exciting effort to increase community awareness of this largely invisible issue and to galvanize community support to stop polluted run-off from reaching Puget Sound.</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-amount-awarded-header\">Amount Awarded</h3><p>$6,000.00</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-year\">Year</h3><p>2014</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-link-header\">Link</h3><a class=\"rose-grants-external-link\" href=\"http://vashonnaturecenter.org\">http://vashonnaturecenter.org</a>",

Program goals include engaging volunteers, students, and local groups, providing environmental education, working to improve water quality, and increasing public awareness and action. The Sno-King Watershed Council will coordinate this project with local environmental organizations, schools, and jurisdictions. A core project team will administer the program, provide training, equipment management, volunteer coordination and mentorship, and information sharing. This is a pilot program designed to expand as additional groups and volunteers are incorporated. Volunteers will use standardized test equipment to monitor water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, & conductivity. They will also assess benthic invertebrates & physical stream characteristics including sediment, habitat complexity, & canopy closure. The project team will acquire test kits and conduct training for volunteers and students. Trained volunteers will train others, check out kits, conduct tests, and return the kits. Students will conduct testing under the tutelage of trained volunteers. Data will be collected regularly from July 2015 to June 2017 on specific streams in the Cedar-Sammamish-Lake Washington watershed. Target streams include Bear Creek, Little Bear Creek, North Creek, Horse Creek, Parr Creek, Little Swamp Creek, Swamp Creek, Lyon Creek, MacAleer Creek, and Thornton Creek. These streams represent a range of sizes and levels of urbanization. Monitoring data will be compiled and published on the Sno-King Watershed Council website. Maps of watersheds will show monitoring sites, with links to monitoring data collected by volunteers, and by local governments and agencies.  Information will additionally be shared via public presentations, social media, and targeted communications to local elected officials.

DERT's first objective is to remove the small dam at the mouth of the Deschutes River.  The dam was built in 1951 to form Capitol Lake with the function of a sediment reservoir and reflecting pool for Washington State's legislative done.  DERT is working on dam removal and estuary restoration at the policy, education and scientific level. DERT has developed an education and outreach strategy that encompasses estuary education, watershed health and all of our volunteers who form the \"Estuary Stewards\" team.   A primary target for volunteer education are youth to ensure a healthy watershed for future citizens.  It is DERT's belief that youth need to be educated and trained to understand, appreciate, restore and protect our precious fresh and marine waters, fish and wildlife species and the watershed they depend on for life. To that end, DERT is developing a Watershed Health and Youth (WHY) training program to give young people a chance to ask questions, learn about ecosystem health and develop their \"sense of place\" within the Deschutes watershed as a direct link to South Puget Sound and the Salish Sea.   This understanding is critical to the health and vitality of this precious ecosystem for future generations. WHY youth will work with DERT's Science Team and study the Deschutes watershed and all of its attributes.  They will take monthly field trips and work in the classroom. They will learn about healthy, functioning ecosystems and identify recreational opportunities within the watershed to nurture a broader sense of understanding and public enjoyment.  They will also learn about the economic opportunities that their watershed provides, and how to sustain the ecosystem while enjoying the benefits of living, working and recreating in this 51 mile river basin.</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-amount-awarded-header\">Amount Awarded</h3><p>$10,000.00</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-year\">Year</h3><p>2015</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-link-header\">Link</h3><a class=\"rose-grants-external-link\" href=\"http://www.deschutesestuary.org\">http://www.deschutesestuary.org</a>",

The undersized culvert at the mouth of the estuary had been creating unnatural flow rates that hindered fish passage, created scour holes, and trapped sediment in the estuary. In 2012, the culvert was replaced with a 90ï¿½ bridge, which the County named the Stillwaters Fish Passage. Phase 2 of this restoration is to replace another culvert in the middle of the estuary, which, we are thrilled to say, will happen in 2017! The MONITORING PROGRAM of this restoration project is critical to evaluation of its success & in demonstrating need for further restoration here and elsewhere around the Sound. The Monitoring Program is citizen-scientist based, with oversight and guidance from the professionals on the Stillwaters monitoring team. With help from the Rose Foundation (thank you so much!), we were able to supervise two dozen volunteers for over 400 hours donated to monitoring in the last 6 months of 2015. EXPANDED EDUCATION: Stillwaters uses this monitoring program not only for protecting the estuary and documenting the restoration work, but also to train and educate our local citizens on the importance of watershed protection, and to create advocates for preservation of natural spaces. We are very excited about the expanded use the monitoring program as training ground for undergraduate interns and graduate research students from Western Washington University and the University of Washington. This is a proposal to support the monitoring program and corresponding community and college education, which receives no other public funding.</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-amount-awarded-header\">Amount Awarded</h3><p>$10,000.00</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-year\">Year</h3><p>2015</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-link-header\">Link</h3><a class=\"rose-grants-external-link\" href=\"http://www.stillwatersenvironmentalcenter.org\">http://www.stillwatersenvironmentalcenter.org</a>",

Our pilot scenario is at the Duwamish River Superfund site, where our volunteer team of dedicated software engineers have launched a demo map called 'Hey, Duwamish!' Our project website is: http://heyduwamish.org. Community members and stakeholders can share ideas, photos, comments, and questions on a detailed interactive map of the 23 year long cleanup. This will enforce transparency, accountability, and community engagement to maximize the $342 million investment mandated by the EPA. We are building a new kind of partnership network that spans the globe. Our work was inspired by a group of civic hackers in Buenos Aires, Argentina who call themselves GarageLab, and built a community monitoring system for the heavily polluted Matanza-Riachuelo River Basin. We saw what they made here: http://quepasariachuelo.org.ar and asked ourselves why this kind of tool doesn't exist for pollution along the Green-Duwamish watershed. We organized online meetings between GarageLab and the Duwamish River Cleanup Coalition, and agreed to form a collaboration to advance new practices in mapping complex socio-environmental conflict scenarios. The result is a new kind of group process called \"collective cartography.\" Here is the theory: Geographic maps are often read-only, and limit themselves by showing \"what is\" rather than \"what is possible.\" By exploring new ground at the intersection of community engagement plus environmental health, we can bridge the gap by combining geographic information systems with collective knowledge for positive change. Our coalition is founded on principles of free and open source software, where supporters can freely adopt and contribute to our work. This will encourage community-driven development toward a public codebase that can evolve and be reused with other community mapping software projects.</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-amount-awarded-header\">Amount Awarded</h3><p>$10,000.00</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-year\">Year</h3><p>2015</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-link-header\">Link</h3><a class=\"rose-grants-external-link\" href=\"http://heyduwamish.org/page/about\">http://heyduwamish.org/page/about</a>",

The project will focus on training farm and resource planners on promoting equine best management practices (BMPs) through the voluntary, incentive-based Sound Horsekeeping Program, which was piloted in Snohomish County with a 2013 Rose Foundation Grant. This regional approach will help counties without adequate resources to market the program to their constituents with a 'train the trainer' approach. Promotion of BMPs by the equine community will be facilitated by brochures, a series of webinars and the Better Ground website. Better Ground is a marketing/branding program currently being adopted by Puget Sound conservation districts to help their clients find resources in their efforts to improve their farms and protect natural resources. </p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-amount-awarded-header\">Amount Awarded</h3><p>$10,000.00</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-year\">Year</h3><p>2016</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-link-header\">Link</h3><a class=\"rose-grants-external-link\" href=\"http://www.horsesforcleanwater.com\">http://www.horsesforcleanwater.com</a>",

The catalyst for taking on this work was simple: The Reserve lies adjacent to a refinery, and the Committee wanted to develop a comprehensive list of intertidal species that would help them monitor ongoing changes and fill data gaps that could prove useful in the event of an oil spill. \r\rThis proposal aims to protect water quality in Puget Sound, and further guard against industrial impacts that could affect the entire Skagit Bay, by developing a more scientifically defensible protocol for monitoring temperature, pH, water quality and species diversity. A strong cadre of citizen stewards is poised to take this project to the next level of accountability.

Whale Scout harnesses the admiration and energy of whale watchers and channels it towards native plants, streams, and our own homes, improving the water quality of Puget Sound for whales, salmon, and ourselves. We do this through educational experiences with volunteer naturalists on shorelines using \"Save Orcas\" brochures; direct salmon habitat restoration at \"Helpin' Out\" events; and our new PodMatch program, connecting up to 500,000 whale watchers each year with salmon habitat restoration events near their homes, scaling up our efforts significantly and providing cool, clean, water free of toxins for Puget Sound. Saving orcas is intrinsically linked to the water quality of Puget Sound. </p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-amount-awarded-header\">Amount Awarded</h3><p>$3,000.00</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-year\">Year</h3><p>2017</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-link-header\">Link</h3><a class=\"rose-grants-external-link\" href=\"http://www.whalescout.org\">http://www.whalescout.org</a>",

Depave projects replace asphalt with green infrastructure that reduces storm water pollution, ameliorates heat islands and builds climate resilience, and improves community health. Seattle's lower Duwamish River Valley is comprised of more than 20,000 acres of highly industrialized hardscape that releases over 1.5 billion gallons/year of polluted storm water into the Duwamish Riverï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a federal Superfund cleanup site. The Duwamish Valley has among the lowest green space acreage and tree canopy citywide, and is home to the low-income and highly diverse neighborhoods of South Park and Georgetown, which suffer from multiple environmental health disparities, including childhood asthma, heart disease, and a life expectancy seven years shorter than the city average. Year 1 of Sustainable Seattle's Depave the Duwamish project produced a basin-wide map identifying potential Depave sites on  industrial lands. Year 2 of the project will construct three demonstration Depave projects representing a variety of land ownerships and regulatory structures (e.g., private, city, school), and Year 3 will utilize lessons learned to develop a larger-scale Depave project through a public-private-community partnership that can serve as a model for a citywide Depave Program. </p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-amount-awarded-header\">Amount Awarded</h3><p>$25,000.00</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-year\">Year</h3><p>2017</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-link-header\">Link</h3><a class=\"rose-grants-external-link\" href=\"http://www.sustainableseattle.org\">http://www.sustainableseattle.org</a>",

In this project, we will develop an inventory of exterior-use products used by businesses and agencies in the Duwamish River and Commencement Bay Superfund source areas which may contain phthalates by interviewing staff at these entities and conducting exterior visual site assessments. We will then prioritize and analyze phthalates in those products as well as in environmental samples from publicly accessible locations and conduct analysis of alternative products. Finally, we will conduct outreach to businesses and agencies about the results and available low/no phthalate alternative products. The project will be overseen by an Advisory Committee of agencies who conduct source control activities in the two cleanup areas. The goals are to reduce phthalates input into stormwater and improve source control, reduce impacts to humans who use the products, and provide information that can be used locally and nationally as we move away from toxic chemicals in products which cause impacts both during use and at end of the life of those products. </p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-amount-awarded-header\">Amount Awarded</h3><p>$25,000.00</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-year\">Year</h3><p>2017</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-link-header\">Link</h3><a class=\"rose-grants-external-link\" href=\"http://zerowastewashington.org\">http://zerowastewashington.org</a>",

Last year Cooke Aquaculture, a Canadian company with major salmon farm operations in Chile, Spain, Scotland, Canada, and Maine, purchased Icicle Seafoods, which owned and operated eight Atlantic salmon net pen facilities currently in Puget Sound. Following their purchase, Cooke Aquaculture unveiled an ambitious plan to dramatically expand their operation in Washington and transform Puget Sound into one of the largest industrial salmon farm operations in the world. Washington is the only state on the West Coast that has not forbidden Atlantic salmon net pens in its marine waters. WFC will consolidate and share the best available science about the environmental threats the Atlantic salmon net pen industry poses, build a broad-based coalition that will advocate against the expansion of this industry in Puget Sound, and use our scientific and legal expertise to demand accountability from the agencies that regulate the Atlantic salmon net pen industry in Washington. </p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-amount-awarded-header\">Amount Awarded</h3><p>$22,000.00</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-year\">Year</h3><p>2017</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-link-header\">Link</h3><a class=\"rose-grants-external-link\" href=\"http://www.wildfishconservancy.org\">http://www.wildfishconservancy.org</a>",

When they learn about the species, they naturally begin to care about it and are eager to learn what they and their families can do to mitigate local marine pollution.</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-amount-awarded-header\">Amount Awarded</h3><p>$8,000.00</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-year\">Year</h3><p>2017</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-link-header\">Link</h3><a class=\"rose-grants-external-link\" href=\"http://killerwhaletales.org\">http://killerwhaletales.org</a>",

The proposed project is novel in that it will integrate the use of UAV technology within the scope of a higher education curriculum to enhance the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of environmental restoration at four established restoration sites within the Green/Duwamish Watershed. Students will get real-world experience gathering and assessing the data and deliverables to inform these sitesï¿½ short- and long-term environmental restoration goals. This project will also explore the utility and scalability of drone technology at restoration sites within the Green/Duwamish Watershed, as an alternative to traditional surveying methods which are too expensive for frequent data collection by grassroots organizations.</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-amount-awarded-header\">Amount Awarded</h3><p>$17,000.00</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-year\">Year</h3><p>2017</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-link-header\">Link</h3><a class=\"rose-grants-external-link\" href=\"https://www.greenrivercollegefoundation.org\">https://www.greenrivercollegefoundation.org</a>",

The ï¿½Re-green the Greenï¿½ WRIA 9 salmon recovery strategy identified Soos Creek, which has a TMDL for temperature and dissolved oxygen, as a high priority area for revegetation to shade the stream.  South Park is a highly urbanized community in Seattle with a large amount of impervious surfaces and polluted stormwater that drains into the Lower Duwamish River.  Mid Sound will partner with the Green River Coalition, Green River College, the Institute for Community Leadership, Sustainability Ambassadors, the Duwamish Infrastructure Restoration Training Corps (DIRT Corps) and the Duwamish Valley Youth Corps to facilitate an exchange of youth leaders, expose the youth to a new part of their watershed, and to engage them in hands on work to improve water quality in their watershed.</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-amount-awarded-header\">Amount Awarded</h3><p>$25,000.00</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-year\">Year</h3><p>2017</p><h3 class=\"rose-grants-link-header\">Link</h3><a class=\"rose-grants-external-link\" href=\"http://www.midsoundfisheries.org\">http://www.midsoundfisheries.org</a>",
