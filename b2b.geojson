        "description": "<h1>Green Roof Denny Middle School</h1>  <p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Sov1NfE.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" title=\"\"></p>  <p>Denny Middle School has a large green roof that was originally designed in 2006 by Bassetti Architects (link to project case study) to slow down the rain from major storm events, capture carbon dioxide from the air, and support both photosynthesis and evapotranspiration. These features function together to reduce the impacts of stormwater runoff on the rest of the school campus. </p>  <p>Most roof tops just capture rain in gutters, drop it through downspouts, and pipe it to the nearest stream, in this case, directly into Longfellow Creek (link to Longfellow Creek Watershed drainage transparent layer with bright blue prominent line for the creek pathway) which flows north just behind the Denny school campus.  If there is pollution in the air or in the materials in the roof top itself, then this pollution is washed into the creek along with the stormwater. </p>  <p>The green roof on Denny Middle School covers 4,300 square feet(?) By engineering this green infrastructure solution into the architectural design choices of the building, Denny was able to reduce its stormwater fee (embed link to pdfs or website) to the city of Seattle by $3,000(?). <br> Immediately after construction, green roofs need to be monitored regularly to ensure that the vegetation thrives. During the first season, green roofs may need to be watered periodically if there is not sufficient precipitation. After the first season, green roofs may only need to be inspected and lightly fertilized about once per year. The roofs may need occasional weeding and may require some watering during exceptionally dry periods. Green roofs need to be maintained as any other landscaped area. This can involve gardening and irrigation, in addition to other roof maintenance. </p>  <h3 id=\"virtual-webcam-tour-for-student-learning\">Virtual WebCam Tour for Student Learning</h3>  <p>To study the engineering design choices that Bassetti Architects (link to project case study) used to construct the green roof on Denny Middle School, the collaborative 6th grade teaching team, (link to photo of teaching team) including the Spanish Dual Language Program, has developed a problem-based curriculum integrated across grade levels, to meet education standards while reducing the impacts of polluted stormwater runoff at their schools. Once a year, students follow their science teachers via webcam up onto the roof for a live interactive tour the green roof engineering system. Students study diagrams of effective green roofs assess the value in reduced stormwater fees, and make annual maintenance recommendations to the school district to ensure that the green roof is functioning as originally designed.  </p>  <p>The goal is help students apply their knowledge of the engineering design process in the real world, in this case, on a fascinating green stormwater infrastructure feature on their own school roof top. </p>    <h3 id=\"multiple-benefits-of-green-roofs\">Multiple Benefits of Green Roofs</h3>  <p>Green roofs can absorb and store approximately 50% of typical storm events.  Due to evapotranspiration and plant uptake, this storage is assumed to recharge once every four days.</p>  <p>Green roofs help cool the neighborhood by reducing the heat island effect. That’s when all of the cement in a city absorbs heat from the sun and radiates it back. Plants help mitigate the heat island effect by holding and releasing moisture, cooling the air.  </p>  <p>Green roofs help insulate the inside of the building, too. You stay cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. And you save money, because you don’t have to spend as much on your energy bill for heating and cooling systems.  </p>  <p>Green roofs take in carbon dioxide from the air and process it through photosynthesis, releasing fresh oxygen that we need to breath, so green roofs help soften the impacts of climate change.  </p>  <p>Green roofs can even attract a greater biodiversity of insects, birds and pollinating bees. </p>    <h3 id=\"heres-how-to-build-a-green-roof\">Here’s How to Build a Green Roof</h3>  <p>At the bottom is the roof deck.  Add some waterproofing material. Then lay down a root barrier, followed by a sheet of moisture retention geotextile. Then add a rigid drainage mat. Next comes some filter fabric, and finally, just the right kind of specialized soil mix and… the plants. </p>  <p>The plants selected for a successful green roof need to be extremely hardy to withstand hot, direct sun and pouring rain with fairly shallow root systems.  </p>  <p>Learn more about the top ten plant species for green roofs: <a href=\"http://inhabitat.com/top-10-plants-for-a-living-roof/\">http://inhabitat.com/top-10-plants-for-a-living-roof/</a></p>",

        "description": "<h1>Longfellow Creek Restoration</h1>  <p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/e2A9bFZ.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" title=\"\"></p>  <p>Volunteers, including student groups from local schools, are taking responsibility for the restoration of Longfellow Creek which is one of only four natural waterways within the Seattle City limits that remains free flowing. </p>  <p>The stream channel is small, averaging two feet deep and three to six feet wide. To some people it is a beautiful urban oasis, and to others it is an unknown or forgotten ditch of water. Longfellow Creek is a three mile waterway running south to north. It begins at the historic Roxhill Bog, runs in a pipe under Westwood Village, daylights past schools and apartments, back up in a big retention pond just before Home Depot, shoots through another pipe, then back into more daylight pasts homes, a bit of forest, a park and a golf course, until it disappears again  through a very long pipe all the way down into Elliott Bay. </p>  <p>Twenty-five percent of Longfellow Creek is in a pipe.  Longfellow was once teeming with salmon. The last known salmon spawning was in 1939. Since 1995, thanks to the efforts of the city and many volunteers, enough habitat has been restored to welcome a small annual number of salmon back to Longfellow Creek. </p>  <p>The problem is that 70-80% of these salmon, returning in good health from their long ocean journey, die within hours of entering Longfellow Creek. This frightening pre-spawn mortality rate is something we can fix.  Pre-spawn mortality happens because over the summer toxic pollution from our neighborhood roads, parking lots, driveways, rooftops and lawns builds up and then, with the first hard rainstorms of the fall, rushes into Longfellow Creek. Much of the pollution in the creek comes from individual sources such as dog pop, carwash grime, fertilizers, pesticides, oil dripping from cars, paint, and gasoline residues. Loose and eroding soil is also a source of pollution.</p>  <p>This same natural event, big rains in the fall, is what triggers the salmon to venture upstream. They want to make sure there is enough cold, clear, water in the creek to successfully reach the spawning ground. Unfortunately, when they do, the toxic runoff hits them hard. It poisons them.(video on research at WSU)  And they die before they can spawn.</p>  <p>There is an ongoing community effort to restore the creek. We need more trees and natural vegetation to capture, slow down, filter and then infiltrate the rain.  But at the same time, we to need work across the entire watershed and way upland from the creek itself to reduce the sources of pollution stormwater runoff and to capture it on site so it percolates back into the groundwater and does not poison the creek. </p>  <p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ybogfCm.jpg\" alt=\"restoration\" title=\"\"></p>  <p>We need to retrofit every house, apartment, school, shopping center and roadway with green stormwater infrastructures, green roofs and cisterns and more trees to make sure that we are infiltrating those same heavy rains right on our own property. The City of Seattle has a goal of treating 700 million gallons of stormwater by 2025.</p>  <h2 id=\"restoration-timeline\">Restoration Timeline</h2>  <p>Spring 2016 80 students in grades 4-8 at Holy Family Catholic School gathered for a day of service-learning to pull invasive plants at this site (map link and photo of workers) 100 community volunteers attended the Duwamish Alive Restoration event.

In <a href=\"activities-partners/default.aspx#map\">this watershed</a>, citizens, scientists, businesses, conservation groups, and governments are working together to respond to the decline of salmon and the lands and waters on which the fish depend. In 2005, the partners completed a <a href=\"plan-implementation/HabitatPlan.aspx\">science-based Salmon Habitat Plan</a>. Carrying out the plan recommendations will protect and restore a healthy watershed ecosystem for both people and fish.  Watershed salmon habitat recovery is part of the work of the <a href=\"http://www.psp.wa.gov/\">Puget Sound Partnership</a>.
